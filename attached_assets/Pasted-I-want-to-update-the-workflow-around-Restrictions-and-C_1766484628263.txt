I want to update the workflow around Restrictions and Country Screening.
 
===================================
1) Merge steps in Workflow Progress
===================================
 
Goal: In the left “Workflow Progress” bar, replace the separate
"Restrictions" and "Country Screening" steps with a single step:
 
  "Country Screening Framework"
 
Implementation:
 
- In the React component that renders the workflow sidebar
  (e.g. WorkflowProgress / SidebarSteps):
 
  - Remove the separate entries for:
      "Restrictions"
      "Country Screening"
 
  - Add ONE entry in their place:
 
      id: "countryScreening"
      label: "Country Screening Framework"
 
- Ensure any highlighting / navigation logic uses this new label,
  but keeps the same underlying phase key as the existing
  country-screening phase (use the existing phase enum value,
  do NOT introduce a new one if not necessary).
 
- Anywhere else in the UI where "Restrictions" or "Country Screening"
  is shown as a step heading, rename it to:
    "Country Screening Framework".
 
Backend phases (fundMandate, restrictions, countryScreening, etc.)
can remain the same for now; this change is primarily UI/labels.
 
 
==================================================
2) Ask Restrictions in a pop-up after Fund Mandate
==================================================
 
Goal: When the user submits the Fund Mandate and clicks
"Continue to Country Screening", show a **Restrictions** pop-up
immediately. Only after the analyst fills/confirm this pop-up
should the tool proceed to the Country Screening Framework phase.
 
Implementation:
 
- On the Fund Mandate screen:
 
  - On click of the "Continue to Country Screening" button,
    do NOT immediately navigate / advance phase.
 
  - Instead, open a modal component (e.g. <RestrictionsModal />).
 
- RestrictionsModal:
 
  - Reuse the same restriction fields you currently have
    in the Restrictions step (e.g. avoid sanctioned countries,
    ESG constraints, sector exclusions, etc).
  - Buttons:
      - "Save & Continue"
      - "Cancel" (closes modal and keeps current state; no change).
 
- When the user clicks "Save & Continue" in the modal:
 
  - Collect the restriction values from the modal form.
  - Send them to the backend the same way you currently would
    from the Restrictions step (same payload structure, same phase
    handler – e.g. phase: "restrictions" or equivalent).
  - After a successful response:
      - Close the modal.
      - Advance the wizard state to the **Country Screening Framework**
        step (i.e. the existing countryScreening phase).
      - Render the Country Screening Framework UI.
 
- If the user presses "Cancel" in the modal:
  - Just close the modal and remain on the Fund Mandate screen.
  - Do NOT advance phase or send restrictions.
 
- The separate full-page "Restrictions" view should no longer be
  reachable from the sidebar (since it has been merged into
  the Country Screening Framework step via this modal).
 
Expected behaviour:
 
1) Analyst fills Fund Mandate.
2) Clicks "Continue to Country Screening".
3) Restrictions pop-up appears, analyst enters constraints.
4) On "Save & Continue", restrictions are saved and the tool goes
   straight into the "Country Screening Framework" step in the
   left workflow bar.
